## You can find all the slide decks, tutorial information, and example code to help you get started using the HPC clusters at UMD. The workshop schedule and accompanying files are as follows: 

**Presentation 1** (~10 min): *Introduction to Super Computers by Daniel Callow* - SD1_IntroToHPCs.pdf

**Breakout session 1** (~5 min): *Small group discussions about what sort of projects would benefit from super computing*

**Presentation 2** (~10 min): *Basics of parallelization by Dushyanthi Karunathilake* - SD2_BasicsOfParallelization.pdf

**Presentation 3** (~10 min): *High performance computing resources at UMD by Phillip Alvarez* - SD3_HPCsAtUMD.pdf

**Breakout session 2** (~5 min): *Get set up on the UMD HPC that you have access to via your school/department*

**Presentation 4** (~10 min): *Getting started: Accessing & using your HPC by Junaid S Merchant* - SD4_Presentations4-5.pdf

**Presentation 5** (~15 min): *Writing & submitting code with examples in MATLAB & R by Junaid S Merchant* - SD4_Presentations4-5.pdf

**Open Q and A session till 14:30**
